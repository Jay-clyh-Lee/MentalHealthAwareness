        <h2>5 Types of <br> <h1>Therapy</h1></h2>
        
        <div> <p>1. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT): CBT is a time-limited therapy
            that focuses on the here and now rather than your childhood. It
            examines the relationship between our situation, mindset, thoughts,
            emotions, behaviour, and physical reactions, It trains you to
            automatically question whether or not your thoughts are facts, which
            slows down your reaction time and helps you feel more emotionally
            stable, CBT is ideal for people who want a therapy that works towards
            solutions, with clear goals, and practical techniques. <br>
            2. Counselling: a counsellor can help you find ways to deal with your
            difficulties and understand how you're feeling. Counselling can be
            particularly useful for people who are going through a difficult time
            such as bereavement, relationship probles, work-stress or other
            life-changing situations. <br>
            3. Mindfulness-based therapies: these therapies focus on teaching you
            to become the observer of your thoughts and feelings. Variations of
            mindfulness-based therapies include mindfulness-based stress
            reduction (MBSR), mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT),
            acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and dialectical behavioural
            therapy (DBT). <br>
            4. Humanistic therapy: humanistic therapies use a range of theories
            and practices to help you understand and enhance your mental
            wellbeing. This approach suits people interested in exploring their lives
            and looking at their issues from a wide range of angles. Variations of
            humanistic therapy include integrative psychotherapy, person-centred
            counselling and gestalt therapy. <br>
            5. Interpersonal therapy (PT): IPT focuses on you and your
            relationships with others and is based on the idea that poor mental
            wellbeing is rooted within our interpersonal relationships.</p> </div>
